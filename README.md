## Challenge

For this week's challenge, the website's index.html file needed to be altered to make it more accessible to people with disabilities and search engines.

I did this by:

- Changing the title
- Changing div elements to be more descriptive by adding nav elements, section elements, and article elements
- Adding ID to the "search-engine-optimization"

I also consolidated CSS selectors to reduce redundant code (and I added comments to CSS and index.html)

The challenge is deployed at https://quasse.github.io/accessessibility-challenge/
